This is the first website that I made using HTML 5, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.
This website is fully functional with 2 web pages linked: the home page and the About page.
In the making of this website, concepts like grid, flex, dropdown, sidebars, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and more have been used.
It can be viewed on devices with large, small and medium screens.
